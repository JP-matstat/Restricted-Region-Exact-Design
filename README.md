# Restricted-Region-Exact-Design
D-optimal experimental design

MATLAB code for a program and GUI that gives D-optimal designs.

There are two folders, one for the program Systematic Search and one for the program One Step. Systematic search is better. I recommend you always use Systematic Search. The reason for the One Step-folder being here is so that users might use the code.

User instructions:

Download the folder "Systematic Search".
Put the downloaded folder in your MATLAB working directory. (For example: C:\Programs\Matlab\Systematic search)
Start MATLAB.
Set the MATLAB working path (working directory) to the directory you saved the folder in. (For example: C:\Programs\Matlab\Systematic search)
Write DUI in the command window. This runs the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the program Systematic Search.
The program pops up.
Start designing experiments!
